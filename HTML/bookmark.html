</p>
<p>computer is a general-purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>
<b id="cpu">cpu</b><p> A central processing unit(CPU),also reffered to as a central processor unit,is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing basic arithmetical.logical,and input out operation of the system.The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960's.The form,design, and implementation of CPU's have changed over the course of their history,but their fundamental operation remains much the same
</p>
<b id="alu">ALU</b>
<p>
In computing,an arithmetic and logic unit(ALU)is a digital circuit that performs integer arithmetic and logical operations.The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer,and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining time.The processors found inside modern CPU's and graphics processing units(GPU's)accomodate very powerful and very complex,ALU's a single component may contain's number of ALU's.

<b id="pl"><h2>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h2></b>
<p>A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.
</p>
<b id="c">c</b>
	<p>C is a high-level and general purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System (OS) in the early 1970s. 
	</p>



<b  id="cpp">c<sup>++</sup></b>
<p>C++ is an object oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style." In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.

<h3 id="dbms">DBMS</h3><p>A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in a database. The DBMS essentially serves as an interface between the database and end users or application programs, ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible.</p>

<b id="rdbms">RDBMS</b>
	<p>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as invented by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. In 2017, many of the databases in widespread use are based on the relational database model.
	</p>
	<b id="oodbms">OODBMS</b>
	<p>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects. Most of the object databases also offer some kind of query language, permitting objects to be found through a declarative programming approach.
    Also called an object database management system (ODMS).
	</p>
	<b id="hdbms">HDBMS</b>
	<p>A DBMS is said to be hierarchical DBMS, when the data is organized like a tree structure. That means, it simply represents the data using parent â€“ child relationship. It is the oldest style of organizing/storing data and still some organizations are using this.
   It follows one to many relationship. i.e. All parents can have more than one child, but each child should have only one parent.
